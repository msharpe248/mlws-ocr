# Roadmap

Ranked by measured evidence, not enthusiasm. Every item names the
observation that motivates it, so a future session can re-check whether
the motivation still holds before spending the effort.

## Now: close the gap to the legacy (non-neural) reference

**Decomposition (2026-09-01, `scripts/compare_legacy_errors.py`).** Two
gaps, not one. Three catastrophic pages (a broken-hairline serif, a
price table, a signature block) explain about a quarter of the deficit;
the merge lattice recovered most of the first. The other three quarters
are *systematic*: on the 27 ordinary pages we score 86.8 vs 95.5, and
that excess is 40% shape substitutions (six times legacy's count — the
classifier), 20% character deletions, 11% case flips (legacy makes 10 in
40k chars; we make 401), 11% digits, 10% punctuation, 7% spaces. We beat
legacy on spurious insertions. Priority order follows the shares:

1. **Classifier quality** — MEASURED (2026-09-01, `scripts/
   classifier_ceiling.py`): on held-out real glyphs the cap-80 1-NN scores
   91.9% top-1; anything that uses the whole harvest scores 98.7–99.0.
   The gain does not transfer by enlarging the 1-NN pool (coverage
   imbalance: no digits in the harvest, so real digits find real letters
   first) but it does transfer by **per-class k-means condensation**
   (`recognize/condense.py`, 60 prototypes/class): broad-30 84.1→84.5
   char / 63.7→65.0 word, synthetic +1.0 char / +2–5 word. Adopted; the live
   model is `build_prototypes.py --condense 60` over the letter AND digit
   harvests (964 real digits via format endorsement). The digits first
   FLIPPED the confusions (letters read as digits) until digit mode became
   a deferred, lexicon-gated decision — see RESEARCH. NEXT on this
   thread: capitals coverage (few real capitals in the harvest); and
   the offline table says a self-trained MLP over the same features
   (99.0) or a 5-NN vote (99.1) sit above condensation (97.5) — the
   overnight candidates, below.
2. **Case** — done (adaptation pins assert shape, not case).
3. **Character deletions** — attribution CORRECTED (2026-09-01): the
   "never segmented" runs were mostly (a) reading-order bookkeeping —
   text present but in a different order from the ground truth; zone-
   ordered scoring puts the order share at **1.4 char points** on
   broad-30 — and (b) suppressed misreads: address lines ('PAssAIc, Na
   07055', fixed by format endorsement), signature-block names, and
   letter-spaced display text read as letter salad ('D~E~D~I~C~A~T~E~D'
   → 'o c o 1 c a T …'). Remaining real families: letter-spaced small
   caps (recognition + grouping), logo lines swallowed by image zones,
   the deferred price table.
4. **Digit and punctuation priors** — punctuation probe (dev-8) found
   the position prior gated at 0.4 x-height while correct commas stand
   0.46–0.62 tall, so commas, apostrophes, colons and semicolons never
   received it; band widened to 0.75 plus a colon/semicolon rule for
   two-part marks (measurement in RESEARCH.md). Digits: done through
   coverage (real digit exemplars) plus the deferred digit-mode
   decision; residual dev-8 digit confusions are '6'→'5' (7) and
   'l'→'1' (9), the latter inside non-lexicon tokens.
5. **Table handling** (page 8588) — deferred by decision, not by data.

Tesseract's **legacy engine has no neural net** and scores 95.3% char /
90.5% word on our thirty-page sample; its LSTM engine scores 95.9 /
92.2. The neural upgrade bought Tesseract 0.6 char points. We score
85.1 / 67.4 (2026-09-01 evening: condensed model with the digit harvest,
deferred digit mode). **The remaining gap is therefore classical engineering,
not model class** — thirty years of it — and that is where the work
belongs. `scripts/compare_legacy.py` produces the paired per-page table
that localizes it.

## Later: overnight training jobs

Self-trained models only (the project's constraint is no *pre-trained*
nets and no vision models; anything we train from our own data is in
scope). Ranked by expected value per unit of risk:

1. **More corpus, no network at all.** The largest single leg of
   2026-09-01 came from vocabulary and frequency coverage, which scales
   by fetching text rather than by training. We use 12 MB; govinfo
   holds far more public-domain federal text.
   `scripts/fetch_modern_corpus.sh` already does the fetch.
2. **A classifier that can absorb the harvest.** Ceiling now measured
   (`scripts/classifier_ceiling.py`, 2026-09-01): held-out real-glyph
   top-1 — incumbent 91.9, k-means 60/class 97.5 (adopted, no training
   needed), regularized QDA 98.7, 1-NN all 98.7, 5-NN vote 99.1, numpy
   MLP 95-256-C **99.0** in ten seconds of training. The MLP is the
   overnight candidate: it needs a recognizer implementation that emits
   (class, cost) lists from logits, and the coverage fix (real digits and
   capitals) first, or it inherits the same imbalance the 1-NN showed.
3. **A bigger char LM.** Hidden 256 → 512, two layers, ~10× data;
   overnight is enough in numpy. Expect one to two word points, from
   the curve so far: trigram → GRU (perplexity 10 → 3.27) gave +2.5
   word; 3.27 → 2.59 gave +1.3.
4. **Multilingual GRUs** (de/fr/es/it) via the same recipe, which
   unlocks non-English documents rather than improving English ones.

**Discipline for any overnight job:** write to a *variant* file and
leave the live model untouched, so the morning begins with a
measurement rather than a changed pipeline. Every leg of 2026-09-01 was
separately attributable because of this.

## Open threads

- **Reading order.** Word recall (75.0) runs well ahead of word
  accuracy (62.1); part of that gap is ordering, not recognition. The
  SCC graph likely already contains the information.
- **Logical layout stage.** A grammar over blocks (bullet list ::=
  bullet+, address block, signature block), the natural consumer of the
  pooled-k segmentation and a revival of IDUR's 1994 DCG approach.
- **Whitespace-rect redesign** against synthetic newspaper fixtures
  (four findings already banked in RESEARCH.md).
- **Photo-heavy magazine recall**, suspected overlap-merge absorbing
  text into photo-fragment boxes.
